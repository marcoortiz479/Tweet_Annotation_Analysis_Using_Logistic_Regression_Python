"As someone with a disability I can’t begin to express how much this frustrates me, especially when they try to excuse it by saying “well I was only there for ___ amount of time” it doesn’t matter that could’ve easily been a time a disabled person needed to park there and couldn’t and couldn’t access an already inaccessible world not built for us. You can park anywhere you can access everything, we can’t and I would think most clients wouldn’t be too happy with knowing they do things like this with zero remorse. I can’t get out of the car or transfer to my wheelchair without having that space. Just because you didn’t get caught doesn’t make it okay or legal.

"At the moment, it looks like NEISD is trying to do a live learning schedule, so the student’s day is already scheduled out from 8-3 (30 minute lunch, 15 minute recess). If I had the choice, we would work much more flexibly so that we make progress, but can do it in a fun way. Ideally I’d love to be able to follow something similar to a Montessori method where student’s learn through experience and can focus on subjects that interest them during enrichment time. 

I also know how important it is for kids to be able to move around while they learn, and not just sit in front of a computer. I’d like to be able to make the assignments as fun as possible. More than likely during asynchronous learning time I will take the assignments and adapt them to be more interactive, even if it’s as simple as doing math problems on a small white board with a dry erase marker. I also have a big back yard so I plan on getting some backyard toys (soccer ball and goals, football, sidewalk chalk, etc)

"I'm a recent transplant both to Texas and to SA having lived all over the US and most recently coming from Southern California (San Diego).

Even though this city has a lot of people it's really a small town. It most definitely doesn't have a Paris or London vibe to it. I would compare it more to the country than the city in almost all ways except for the traffic. Glasgow might actually be a decent comparison to make but we're not as metropolitan or diverse as Berlin.

This isn't a media or tech hub by any means. What I mean is that there aren't really that many tech companies around here (we have a tough time hiring the amount of talent that we need) and there's not the same computer culture that there is in other cities. It's very much a blue collar country town.

But the cost of living is less here than in Austin or other towns which sets you up for more financial success as you're not going to be paying out as much in rent, gas, etc as you would somewhere else.

As far as UT vs UTSA I would say that neither are prestigious universities when it comes to tech. But I don't think it really matters as much as people think it does. The best thing you can do while in university is to get as much experience as you can.

There's no way of knowing if you'll like it here or not. I've been here for 6 months and I'm still adjusting to it. But I think that being in university will help that transition more.

Good luck at whatever you decide!",1,1

"Nah salaries are generally about the same as most areas shy of large tech areas, but there is a slight increase the closer you go to Austin.

"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

I found so many stories like what you described, on Yelp, so I called them the next day to cancel service and request a refund on the $10 I was charged. I didn't even ask for a refund on the $11. So I wait a week, still no credit for the mystery $10 charge that I didnt approve.

"A lot of people here have ideas about how reddit works but I don't think they actually spend much time looking at the subreddit rules that make reddit work and that make a lot of the subreddits what they are.

/r/funny banes tumbler and even reddit.com. That's right, you can't link to a reddit url on /r/funny.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow.

"Yes, it's most highly concentrated in water vapor. But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up.

"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",1,1

"I was under the impression Mayor Castro was aggressive toward courting Google.   Since he bailed to be on the President's Cabinet..../shrug.

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

"It sounds reasonable on the surface, but the end result is the increasingly unsustainable level of wealth inequality in our country. When workers are atomized into individual contract signers with employers it creates a vast power imbalance. But with a union, workers can band together to advocate for their interests on a more level playing field. Without any unions, you get a race to the bottom as profit-seeking drives downward pressure on wages.

The only exceptions are high skilled, high in-demand industries (like tech) where workers can get away with demanding high salaries. That's great for knowledge workers, but our society also needs janitors, gas station attendants, shelf stockers, and other roles where profit-seeking capital has driven wages below cost of living in many areas.",0,0

The degree by itself is pretty meaningless without experience or practical application. It also heavily depends on exactly what field you're trying to break into. Companies are going to want sample code / programs for devs, they'll want certifications for anything from project managers, to sysadmins, to account managers. 

The advantage that entering the college world does give you is on-campus or campus affiliated hiring programs. Lots of tech companies host job fairs and direct hire graduating students.

"""H-E-B said it has expanded its multi-year deal with marketing technology and in-store customer experience provider Stratacache — an ongoing deal that provides the food retailer with greater digital insights into its customers.

Using sensor-based insights gathered from Stratacache’s Walkbase tool, H-E-B gains a richer understanding of the service level in their stores, and will use the actionable data to advance many aspects of the in-store shopping experience. With the expansion of the existing Walkbase advanced solution, H-E-B will gain an even richer understanding of how to better serve their customers.

""Stratacache has proved to be a valued innovation partner with a clear history of delivering customer-focused solutions,"" said Paul Tepfenhart, senior vice president of omnichannel commerce and emerging technology at H-E-B. ""At H-E-B, we never stop looking for ways to improve our experience by providing the best customer and partner solutions. Our relationship with Stratacache moves us forward on this mission.""

The move is just the latest deal that shows how food retailers are beefing up their technology infrastructure to learn more about shoppers and generally improve services.

Artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, can be custom-tailored to the grocery vertical offers retailers the ability to deeply personalize online shopping experiences instead of compelling shoppers to wade through tens of thousands of possible choices. ThryveAI, a Mi9 Retail retail brand, launched last month and already touts supermarket clients such as Meijer, Wakefern Food Corp., ShopRite, Mariano's, Giant Eagle and more. Now, ThryveAI has partnered with taste intelligence company Halla to integrate grocery-specific AI into the ThryveAI digital commerce platform""

"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

I saw someone suggest nextdoor and that will probably be your best bet! I was on the other side about a year ago (found a couple dogs wandering and was trying to track down the owners) and that’s what did the trick. If you have a neighborhood Facebook group try that as well. Also try animal control and some local vets each day, though hopefully you’ll find her more quickly. Someone may have come across her and called animal control - it can take them until the next business day to pick up after a call - or taken her in to a vet to see if she’s chipped.

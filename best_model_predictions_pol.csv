"The Uranusians who, with all their technology and advanced societal structure, didn’t think it was cool as they were unable to deter the path of the planet sized object that impacted their home world causing the tilt. 

They had detected the object 200 years before impact. Calculated its trajectory. They knew impact was likely. 

They dedicated 2 generations (Uranusian life span is some 150 years) of their top scientific and engineering minds to prevent the problem. 

Futile effort after futile effort, the object arrived. 

As a last ditch attempt to preserve something of their people, they loaded a small spacecraft with a few people, supplies, and information regarding their society. 

They shot the spacecraft toward Sol, hoping one of the inner planets would prove hospitable enough. 

The craft reached Earth, but only after being hyper accelerated by the gravity of Jupiter. Like a rock in a sling, Jupiter whirled the craft around and shot it out directly at earth with amazing velocity. 

This craft came crashing down to Earth in the area that is now known as the Yucatán peninsula. 

And that’s why we don’t have dinosaurs. 

So I’d say it’s pretty un-cool.",0,0

They literally say that they will engage in violence in the police ask - and will open fire if the police run. Check out the last 50 seconds of [this](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3162806573778976&amp;id=1318988724858579&amp;anchor_composer=false),0,0
"&gt;Outside of being in a similar colored shirt and he was originally described as having basketball shorts with no specific color.  And he was a black male as was told to them by the victim, on foot in  the area. **You act like they just stopped him for no fucking reason at  all.**

That's a lie. He matched an initial description and that's fair. Ometu is right to be upset because he doesn't know what's going and probably doesn't want any involvement.

If you watched the video that's *available on this sub* you'd hear that the police later get a correct description which Ometu does not match and they proceed to attempt to move Ometu to the victim's location...

&gt;If you gave a shit about the woman’s safety, you wouldn’t be cheering on  a total piece of shit that wasted the cops time when HE FUCKING HEARD  HER on the phone with the cop trying to figure out if he was the  boyfriend or not.

You need to watch the video and watch the part where the police officer gets a clear description FROM THE VICTIM that clears Ometu of any involvement with her.

Then proceed to watch how the cop elects to ignore this CORRECT description.

"So you're saying it's what he didn't say rather than what he did say? At least that makes sense. But if that's the truth then our society is breaking down more and more everyday. Why do you feel the need for gratification and support from a man you don't know and will never meet? I still stand behind my statement that people are looking for things to get offended about, and it's a damn shame. That's like saying it's my birthday and I get a phone call telling me I should eat cake. Sure it may be unconventional, but I'm sure as hell not gonna get upset over something so petty. The fact that they took the time out to even call is better than what most people do. I realize it's his job, but be grateful he even talked about it. I personally believe women's day, black history month, Hispanic heritage, and the lot are very sorry holidays. It's saying ""we were mistreated so now recognize us"" well maybe it would go a lot more smoothly if instead of boasting about it you fight for true equality. Don't expect men to open doors for you or not hit you when you swing first. I was raised a gentleman of Texas quality, but after experiencing life and the equality fights, it's only fair to have TRUE equality or none at all. That being said, you don't need a holiday to stamp your mark on history ""you know it, I know it, everybody knows it"" therefore it can only be used as a medium to attract sorrow and attention. I'd like to hear your take rather than massive down votes this time, because that action goes hand in hand with what I'm saying right now. ",1,0
"I was under the impression Mayor Castro was aggressive toward courting Google.   Since he bailed to be on the President's Cabinet..../shrug.

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

"Obviously I'm gonna be a bit biased, but I honestly think people would enjoy it regardless of if they're into anime or not. We market as an anime convention, sure, but that's not what we're all about.

This year our theme is Fantasy/RPG, so we've got this big ticket Final Fantasy concert and related. There are a lot of people coming out for that who are interested in the franchise and/or orchestral music (https://ffnewworld.com/concert/sanjapan/). 

Speaking of music, there are a lot of people who come out for our musical guests. Entrance to Teddyloid's set and the ALL OFF concert are both included with the badge you purchase. Give 'em a listen, if you're into that.

We've got a lot of gaming content, as well! Video, board, table top, card, whatever, you name it. Not only do we have free play areas where you can enjoy things with friends (or make new ones), we've got scheduled tournaments as well. And we even have this neat retro game museum that people are free to peruse and even play a few consoles in.

Plus, I know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetups/panels (which again, aren't just restricted to anime fandoms). If you're really curious, I'd suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule (http://san-japan.org/events/schedule) to see if there are things there you might be interested in. Note that doesn't contain our gaming schedules, or the stuff that's open regularly like karaoke or the retro game museum. 

Also, there are also a lot of people who go just to enjoy/interact with/take pictures of the really awesome cosplays we get. I don't always know the fandoms, but we can all appreciate a well made cosplay. The cosplay show is wildly popular.

I know literally the most basic of basics about anime. Like, Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon are about as far as I ever really got.

"I'm for option #2 -- we shouldn't be dictating what websites can or can't be posted, that's just insane for this type of website.

However, since you work for EN, I wanted to reply directly to you... dude, you should use whatever power and influence you have to encourage the higher-ups (or the tech guys in charge of the website) to consider a cleaner approach to monetizing a free website.

Loading it up with far too many ads, including popups/popovers, and forcing people to click through slideshows of all things to view the content, is frustrating and only leads people to strongly dislike the website which will reduce the number of visitors and may even discourage people from subscribing to the premium version.

"Last week, a stowaway dog found on a train that traveled from Mexico to San Antonio is now in its forever home.

According to Animal Care Services, employees at a local recycling plant were inspecting a train shipment from Mexico on Thursday and found a scared 4-year-old female Australian Shepherd mix in an open-top railroad car.

ACS officers were called to the site after employees at the plant said the pup, who was later named Lana, wouldn't move from the 9-foot high railroad car.

""It is a mystery how this girl got herself into this situation,"" said Lisa Norwood, public information officer for ACS. ""The car was so high and closed from all four sides.""

Officers climbed into the railroad car and eventually pulled the frightened dog out of the railcar using a makeshift harness, ACS said in a Facebook post on Monday. She was transported to ACS and was adopted the next day.",0,0

&gt;We both like cycling (road and mtb), hiking, camping and going on weekend trips to nearby destinations.

Cycling is def covered (there is an 85-mile paved greenway that goes all over the city and it's *great*). There is great camping and hiking a short drive out of the city (esp west/northwest/north). Some *really* good day trips/weekend trips available: Austin, Fredericksburg (Texas wine country), 2-3 hours to some really solid beaches, Kerrville (folk festival, river stuff), Canyon Lake, etc.  


&gt;I enjoy gardening and history related things.

Some cool native plants that do really well here. Understand, it is *very*, very hot. We are in Hardiness Zone 8b if you want to google and see what does well here *naturally*. Other things will do fine, but know too that we are regularly under some significant watering restrictions, at least this summer. LOTS of cool history stuff here in south central Texas. The missions, Gonzalez TX, history museums, etc.  


&gt;Food.

You'll be fine. I recently found a fantastic Thai place that I'm going to give a lot of money. Amazing Mexican and BBQ, of course, and more and more upscale dining is coming to the ""cool"" parts of town (Southtown, The Pearl, etc.). The part of town you are in will matter. I'm not too far from the Medical Center and there seems to be a lot more variety over here as opposed to where you work will be located.  


&gt;We both would enjoy somewhere that is more ""greener"" and more established.

You'll find more established, large-tree lots between 410 and 1604 (north/south boundary), and I10 and Thousand Oaks (east/west boundary), and I think in your budget. There are some great parks and green spaces in the northwest and central parts of that block, and the [Howard Peak Greenway](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Parks/Linear%20Creekways/HWP%20Greenway%20Trail%20Map.pdf?ver=2022-04-21-092311-137) runs all throughout. The northwest side will start to get far from your work (it's about 25 minutes right now with no traffic), but I think it's still doable. Like you said, it's very much a car-centric city and we have a pretty solid road system.

Anyway, I'm a big fan and enjoy a lot of the same things as you and your wife. Think you could really enjoy it. Best of luck! Cheers!",0,0

"Absolutely. Agree with everything you said. There is no doubt that CPS will need this.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. 

&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)

&gt;*Five Ways To Make Your Resume Sink Faster Than The Titanic*

&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement – I swap “Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoint” for “Proficient in Breathing Oxygen” and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes I’ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to “sink” your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with “Fluency in English,” I assume you are “fluent” in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So don’t re-assure me.

"The city manager can only act within the constraints set by the city council, the city charter, and state law. How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that she’s been able to do this quite well.

But it’s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you don’t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and I’m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, that’s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not “bogeymen” or “scapegoats” for all the city’s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the city’s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities’ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that it’s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and it’s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. She’ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where “at least it’s a dry heat.” Similarly, it’s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",1,1

"&gt; One if the best explanations I've seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8

I'll have to watch that at home. It's blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn't think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it's a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)
(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?


Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. 

There are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn't COVID related and shouldn't be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. 

Economics.  The ultimate ""facts don't care about your feelings"" subject.  :D 


Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I'm assuming you're American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it's a jobs program. 

""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we'll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". 

We have social security - it's in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I'll be lucky to never use.   I'd argue that it works, but could work better.   

If we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what's better for everyone. 

Now we just need to keep voting in better politicians who actually have OUR interests at heart, and toss them out the moment their lies and bullshit comes to light.",1,1

"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

"the thing is, there will always still be someone who will resort to the clothes hanger. A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

San Antonio is building expensive condos and expensive high rise apartments that San Antonians cannot afford, now you have entire high rises completely vacant.

San Antonio is on the fast track to being the next Detroit.

San Antonio is a poor city that hates poor people.

"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is “when will we hit herd immunity?”

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it’s an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we’ve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We’re now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it’s better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It’s an end point, and it’s much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0

"I think this is pretty spot on.  Around 10 years ago I had left San Antonio to go to school in Austin and at the time San Antonio couldn't hold a candle to the type of young urban life someone living in Austin could have.  

That's all changed I feel like over the last 5 years.  Even after I came back to SA after college there wasn't much to do in San Antonio.  Every bar seemed to be located in a strip mall.  Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

I ended up in Austin for tech, but visit San Antonio regularly and see all the changes that have occurred.  My career and future is most likely in Austin but I would love to move back to San Antonio for the culture that's been revitalized over the last few years.",0,0

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams — while pimping Amber and Cooper — was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""

&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber — the name she used while she was being trafficked — asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",1,1
